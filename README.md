# Interaction-Enhanced Co-evolutionary algorithm for Reduced Energy Consumption in Electric Vehicle Routing

An in-development Python implementation of the interaction-enhanced co-evolutionary algorithm for electric vehicle routing, based on the work of [Shouliang Zhu and Chao Zang](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1568494624008871), extended with a focus on reduced energy consumption.

Compile with g++ src/main.cpp src/readInstance.cpp src/calculateDistances.cpp src/nearestNeighbour.cpp src/calcCost.cpp src/randomItem.cpp src/rouletteWheel.cpp src/routingOptimization.cpp -o iecaRun
Run with .\iecaRun.exe _PATH_ value
